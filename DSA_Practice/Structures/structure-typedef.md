Common usage of typedef with structures in C.


`typedef` is a keyword in C that allows you to create an alias (a new name) for existing data types. When used with structures, it can simplify the syntax and make the code more readable.

Here's a basic example of how `typedef` can be used with structures:

Without `typedef`:

```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1;
    //...
    return 0;
}
```

With `typedef`:

```c
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Student;

int main() {
    Student s1;
    //...
    return 0;
}
```

In the first example, you have to use the keyword `struct` every time you declare a variable of the `Student` structure. In the second example, `typedef` is used to create an alias `Student` for `struct {char name[50]; int age;}`. This allows you to declare a variable of the `Student` structure more simply, without needing the `struct` keyword each time.

This is the basic concept of using `typedef` with structures in C. It's a common practice that can make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
